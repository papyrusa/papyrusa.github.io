  First, you should have a clear image of your goal.
Then you will have a better chance to achieve it.
Do you know Hanyu Yuzuru, a figure skater?
When he was a little kid, he said he wanted to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games.
He achieved this goal when he was 19 years old.
Like Yuzuru, successful athletes tend to have a vivid image of the goal that they want to achieve.
  Second, declare your goal.
By doing so, you cannot give it up easily, and you may also get help from others.
Here is one good example.
A high school girl declared her goal to make a box lunch for herself every day for five months.
She needed to get up at five in the morning to make one.
She almost gave up, but her family and friends supported her.
Eventually, she achieved her goal.
